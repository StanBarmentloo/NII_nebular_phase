# SUMO Results

This folder contains all the SUMO spectra of the model runs considered in the paper. The models have been run using the 'explosion_models' from
the 'data_creation' section as inputs, using the scripts provided in 'job_automator'.

At the location of this README, the following folders exist:

- 150d: This folder contains the SUMO spectra at 150 days post explosion for our he3p3, he4p0, he5p0, he6p0 and he8p0 input models
- 200d: This folder contains the SUMO spectra at 200 days post explosion for our he3p3, he4p0, he5p0, he6p0 and he8p0 input models
- etc...
