# Mixing Results

This folder contains the results from the 2D mixing simulations that are discussed in section 3.1.2 and figures 3 and 4 of the paper. These simulations may be obtained through request 

At the location of this README, the following files exist:

abundance_4mshe_mixing.dat : This contains the post-mixing composition of the M = 4 Msun progenitor.

abundance_4mshe_presn.dat : This contains the pre-mixing composition of the M = 4 Msun progenitor.

abundance_33mshe_mixing.dat : This contains the post-mixing composition of the M = 3.3 Msun progenitor.

abundance_33mshe_presn.dat : This contains the pre-mixing composition of the M = 3.3 Msun progenitor.
