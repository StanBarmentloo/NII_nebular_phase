This folder contains all the explosion models used in the paper, as well as some previous iterations.
The models were created using the 'converter' workbook in 'data_creation'.

At the location of this README.md (level 2), the following folder exist:

- v1p0_expl_models : These are the most recent (12-06-2023) models. Their Ni56 masses are the high-end values in Table A.2 in Dessart et al., 2021. Their chi value is 30
- v_expl_models : These models were created sometime in may. They use the Ni56 masses defined as in Table A.2 in Dessart et al., 2021 under the column 'This work'. Again, chi is 30
